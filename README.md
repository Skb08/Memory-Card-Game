# Memory Card Game Project 🃏

This is a simple Memory Card Game project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the player needs to match pairs of cards with the same images. Here's a brief overview of the project.

## Project Structure 📂

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: This file defines the structure of the game's web page.

2. `script09.js`: This JavaScript file contains the game's logic, such as card flipping, matching, and shuffling.

3. `style09.css`: The CSS file contains the styles and animations used in the game.

## How to Play 🎮

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.

2. You'll see a grid of cards with question mark icons on one side and various images on the other.

3. Click on a card to flip it and reveal the image underneath.

4. Try to match pairs of cards with the same image by clicking on them one at a time.

5. If you successfully match a pair, the cards will remain face up. If not, they will shake briefly and then flip back over.

6. The "No. of Flip" counter keeps track of the number of card flips you've made.

7. The game continues until you successfully match all eight pairs.

8. You can reset the game by refreshing the page.
